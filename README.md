Spot-On will then save the users last three results in the history page.This SpotOn application gives the user a chance to listen to their songs on shuffle and get a playlist of the first top five songs that they can listen to on the go. As the user you can pick a genre and five songs will be generated to the right with a link to a youtube video for the first song. All the playlists that you generate will be saved to the local storage for your retrieval. There is also a meet the teams page that has links to the devs Linkedin, email and GitHub and a brief summary of the devs backgroud and coding experience.
